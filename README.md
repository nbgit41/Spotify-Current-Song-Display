# Spotify-Current-Song-Display
A webapp to display the current song playing from spotify

IT IS IMPARITIVE YOU FOLLOW ALL INSTRUCTIONS IN THIS READ ME.

make sure the text file is set up before running the .exe file. (instructions below)

You will need api access information from https://developer.spotify.com/

Instructions on what info to put where is in the spotify_secret.txt file

MAKE SURE THAT YOU SET THAT UP PROPERLLY BECAUSE IT WILL BREAK AND NOT WORK IF YOU DO IT WRONG THE FIRST TIME
  AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU LOG IN WITH THE CORRECT SPOTIFY ACCOUNT THE FIRST TIME OR ELSE IT WILL ALSO BREAK
    you can change accounts by deleting the .cashe file it creates

TO SEE IT:

  http://localhost:{port}/
  or in most browsers localhost:{port}

  replace "{port}" brackets and all whith whatever port you set in the config file.

  if you have it accessible by other computers (mentioned line 20) then you will need to get the ipv4 address of the host pc and replace localhost with that ip address.

  
I will be adding instructions and pictures for setting this up in OBS at a later time
